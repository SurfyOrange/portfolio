          <h4>About Me:</h4>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Kalyan Reddy, and I recently graduated from Mallareddy College 
            in 2023. I pursued a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). 
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for technology 
            and its application in communication systems. I am excited to embark on a career 
            in this field and contribute to the ever-evolving world of electronics and communication. 
            With a curious and determined mindset, I am eager to explore new challenges and 
            opportunities in the engineering industry.
